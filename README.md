## Introduction

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language.  Understanding input/output and arithmetic operations is crucial for building any C program. This repository provides a PowerPoint presentation that visually explains these concepts along with practical C code examples to reinforce the learning.

## Presentation Overview

The PowerPoint presentation covers the following topics:

* **Input/Output Operations:**
    * `printf()` for displaying output to the console.
    * `scanf()` for reading input from the user.
    * Formatted input and output.
    * Examples of using `printf()` and `scanf()` with different data types (integers, floats, characters, strings).
* **Arithmetic Operations:**
    * Basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo).
    * Operator precedence and associativity.
    * Integer and floating-point arithmetic.
    * Type casting and conversions.
    * Examples demonstrating the use of arithmetic operators.

## Code Examples

The `src` directory contains C code examples that accompany the presentation.  These examples demonstrate the concepts discussed in the slides.  Key examples include:

* `input_output.c`: Demonstrates basic input and output using `printf()` and `scanf()`.
* `arithmetic.c`:  Illustrates arithmetic operations and operator precedence.
* `type_casting.c`: Shows how to perform type casting and conversions.
* `formatted_io.c`: Covers formatted input and output with `printf()` and `scanf()`.
